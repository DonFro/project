# project overview:
We aim to tackle voice clarity issues caused by prolonged reverberation times in enclosed spaces. Reverberation, persistent sound reflections post-production, affects comprehension, particularly voice clarity, measured for sound pressure level reduction. The project targets identifying frequency ranges with extended reverb times due to varying surface material sound absorption coefficients.
